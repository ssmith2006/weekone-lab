    <h1>The Color Purple</h1>
    <p>An epic tale following the life of Celie, (played by Whoopie Goldberg), an African-American woman living in the South who survives  abuse and bigotry from the hands of her husband and other male figures in her life. After Celie's abusive father gifts her off to "Mister" (played by Danny Glover), who is as horrible as him, things become even more horrendous. She is forced to seek refuge and friendship with people from different walks of life, including Sophia and Shug Avery. Through those friendships she finds resilience, love, and most of all <strong>FREEDOM</strong>!</p>
